# Book Search Engine

## The Task

To refactor a REST API book search application into a GraphQL application.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- Express implimentation and use
- React implimentation and use
- The use of API's and handling their data
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it
- A deeper understanding of MongoDB and using Express and GraphQL with Apollo to manipulate a database

## Usage

This project is deployed on Heroku at https://booksearchengine-olk.herokuapp.com/. It can be accessed and used by signing up and searching for books. A book can be saved to your list and viewed later, and whilst on the list will show up as on the list in the search. You can also remove books from that list in the See Your Books page.
